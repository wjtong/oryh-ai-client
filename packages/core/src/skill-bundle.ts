/**
 * ORYH skills, installed from ORYH's MCP endpoint.
 *
 * The capability an ORYH agent has is not compiled in: a tenant admin redefines business logic and
 * everyone's skills change. So this client installs the skills a person is entitled to, into the
 * root the agent runtime scans, and re-syncs when the server says they differ. Nothing here decides
 * what a skill may do — the API's own `require_permission` is the gate, and the server only serves
 * skills the holder's role already covers.
 *
 * The skills come over MCP, not as the downloadable bundle (ADR-0012). The bundle renders the
 * person's API key into SKILL.md, and loading a skill hands its body to the model, so the key went
 * out with the request and into the Session. Over MCP the same skills are rendered for that
 * delivery: no key, no scripts, and every API call is a tool the Host runs with the connection's own
 * credential. Each prompt is a skill's SKILL.md; each resource is one of its reference files.
 *
 * See `docs/23-oryh-skills.md`.
